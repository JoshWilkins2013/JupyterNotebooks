A collection of miscellaneous analyses done in jupyter.<br>

## AD9912 DDS spur calculator

Predicts the spurs associated with specific frequencies generated by the AD9912 DDS.

## Alternative Phase Noise Measurement System

An alternative approach to measuring phase noise. Used when the noise floor of your instruments are higher
than the device you are trying to measure.

## Buying a House

If you're anything like me, then I'm sure you're sick of paying rent, wondering 
why you are paying someone else when this money could go into owning a house. 
At first, it seems like a no-brainer! Trade your rent in for a mortgage payment 
and then at least some of your money is being saved. But there are a bunch of things 
you don't consider when this thought first crosses your mind. Here's to shedding 
some light on purchasing your first house.

## Output Power Controller

An adjustable output power stabilizer circuit utilized in a 12 GHz synthesizer. 
Designed with both the ADL6010 and the LTC5564 envelope detectors.

## Quantization Error

Sampling a signal causes rounding errors, produced by the difference in the actual value 
of the signal to the measurable value. This notebook takes a look at preconditioning 
the signal to reduce this error.

## Stepped Input Response

Given a stepped input, the output at the 'hold' regions (transient responses) are captured. 
The script returns two csv files; The averaged results and the transient responses.

## Temperature Dependency

Approximating the temperature dependency of a synthesizer. Characterized the bandpass filter within the synthesizer 
since it was expected to have the greatest contribution to the synthesizer's temperature dependency.
