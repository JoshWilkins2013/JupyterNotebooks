# Quantization Error

Sampling a signal causes rounding errors, produced by the difference in the actual value 
of the signal to the measurable value. The degree of this error is directly proportional 
to the number of bits (resolution) used to measure the signal's value and the number of points 
used to sample the signal. Besides increasing the resolution, the quantization error can also be 
reduced by altering the shape of the signal.
